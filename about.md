I'm a computational biologist at Flinders University, South Australia, and a PhD candidate in my final year. My research involves computational modelling and simulation of the intestines to bring together many types of wetlab measurement in 3D. I write the software for this research myself, and code predominantly in C++ and R. 

This blog is a work in progress that I'm developing in bits and pieces of spare time. On it, I'll be writing blog posts, trying out data science techniques and putting together guides for all sorts of coding-based projects.

In the mean time, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/helendockrell/) and [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Helen_Dockrell/) (no papers yet, but a few in the pipelines at once, so it'll be spectacular in a couple of months!) 

Feel free to get in contact if you want to talk about starting up data science events in Adelaide (intro to R or Processing or data structures), or if you're interested on collaborating on computational biology projects.
